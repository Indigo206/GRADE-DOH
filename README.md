## Notes on the data

### MASTER used for GRADE DOH models 12.8.2020 for SH.csv

This is the population data. It is created from the Excel database of the same name (Team/Databases), simply by stripping out the first two extraneous rows

### simulations_data.csv

This is the simulation data, i.e. the governance data for each country together with the DOH outcomes. It also includes under-5 and maternal mortality data.

Currently, this is a merge of data from "Copy of simulations health indicators and pop data 30.9.2020" (drive) that has been extracted from a single sheet, and also "u5m and mmr survival simulation.xlsx" (Team/Databases).

Reliance on this file should be negated by drawing everything from the MASTER spreadsheet in the next update.
